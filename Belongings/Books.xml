No one really knows where these intelligent chests actually come from. Legends only passed down that they suddenly appeared and never left. Once they have chosen an owner, they follow them everywhere. Not exactly step by step, as they are very curious chests, but as soon as their owner is in danger, they teleport through space and time to be by their side. 

Due to their many feet, the chests are incredibly fast. If you ever see a chest charging toward you, the last thing you'll probably see is a row of gleaming white teeth and a large tongue.
